# ownership-chord-graph
As my first foray into D3, I created this interactive chord graph for FundFire which shows the degree to which large, publicly traded institutional asset managers own one another, their competitors. The data was collected from the Thompson Reuters Eikon database. The idea behind the visualization being potential for reduced incentives to compete on lower prices between asset managers with large ownership shares of one another.
